Mine8088 is a version of Minesweeper for the IBM PC. It only requires an
8088/8086 CPU, a MDA/CGA card (or compatible later card) and a modest amount
of RAM (exact amount not established, but even 64 KB RAM should be enough;
the game .COM is only about 2.5 KB).

Currently DOS is required for some functionality, but the core game works
without using any DOS functions.

Supported game features:
* Basic minesweeper gameplay (randomized mines, moving around, flagging)
* Beginner, intermediate and expert modes like on Windows
* Custom mode (up to 80x24 on 80-column display)
* Marks (?)
* Timer
* Mine counter
* Chording (try to reveal an already open tile with the correct number of
  flags around it to chord)

To build, simply assemble DOSMINE.ASM with NASM into a .COM file. By default,
a 80-column CGA version will be built. To build a 40 column version, modify
the .ASM file and set COLUMNS to 40. To build a MDA version, set MDA to 1.

Controls are listed in the intro:
* Arrow keys move
* [Space] Reveal/Chord
* [F]lag [M]ark [R]estart
* [Q]uit (or [ESC])

Caveats:
* While CGA/MDA compatible, Mine8088 does not make any attempt to prevent
  "snow" artifacts when updating the screen.
* Timer is not forgiving for slower systems where revealing tiles may
  take some time.
